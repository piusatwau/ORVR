**Project Concept for ORVR**

ORVR is an open-source initiative designed to bridge critical gaps in medical education and training through the innovative use of virtual reality (VR). The project aims to foster a global community of developers, designers, and medical professionals collaborating to create immersive VR simulations that enhance learning and accessibility. ORVR focuses on three core areas: medical education, health education, and surgical training. It seeks to provide VR modules that simplify complex medical concepts like anatomy, pathology, and clinical case management, making them accessible to students worldwide. Furthermore, it envisions engaging health education experiences to empower patients with knowledge about their conditions and treatments, while offering realistic surgical simulations to improve the dexterity and decision-making skills of medical practitioners in a safe and risk-free environment.

ORVR also serves as a collaborative platform where creators can share assets, innovate, and design immersive healthcare experiences inspired by real-world clinical scenarios. The project includes opportunities for developers to gain firsthand insight into the healthcare environment through clinical immersion experiences at partner hospitals. This exposure allows developers to observe hospital workflows, patient interactions, and clinical procedures, equipping them with the perspective necessary to design realistic and impactful VR simulations. With an ambitious goal to revolutionize healthcare simulation education, ORVR strives to attract the attention of research institutions and medical colleges, encouraging the adoption of VR technology to elevate medical training standards globally.
